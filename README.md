# Kmeans Color Quantization

A function that takes the input of the image path and the desired amount of clusters. The image is converted from a 3D array then into a 2D arrary. Then it is passed into the Kmeans function and the values are rounded. Lastly the 2D array is converted back into a 3D array before a plot of the original and quantized image are returned. 

The desired amount of colors is the amount of Clusters entered. So for four cluster the returned image will only have four colors
